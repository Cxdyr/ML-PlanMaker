[Training data description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hPkIP76za0HWy6BrmT2m5MhoQq0FPAC-Pq3jwkr1mQU/edit?usp=sharing)


The model is trained on a custom dataset that incorporates user attributes - fitness goal (hypertrophy, strength), and body parts targeted in a workout (5 options, with max 2 selected by the user). The model analyzes patterns in the training data to determine optimal branching decisions, its interpretability is easy to understand why certain predictions are made.
